If using the same ruler just print the already compiled STL files in the output directory.

Edit the main scad file to change variables, open the different scad files in the output directory to easily export different parts.

The center parts are specifically for holey calibration.  Inner and outer are slighly modified for other, general purpose measurements.

If you are unfamiliar with how to read verneir scales I highly recommend learning; it's a really cool thing and the tools that use them are cheaper, smaller, and don't require batteries.  

This one is unusual because it has a second scale going backwards.  This was added because the diagonal measurements got too close to the end of the ruler.  It actually makes it easier to read when the result is right around zero.
